            <li><b>PRICING:</b> In case our main source of pricing fails, the extension now falls back to the pricing API by Steaminventoryhelper, which is also getting cached for the duration of a session to reduce network load. Overall, this should improve reliability of pricing without any overhead.</li>
            <li><b>SITES:</b> The 'unique items' tab is now also supported by API-based features such as the sticker pricing.</li>

        <ul class="VersionText">
            <li><b>CHANGE:</b> The 10s interval option of the auto-refresh feature has been removed due to unjustifiably long rate limits after very short periods of usage. For now it is unclear if rate-limits by CSFloat can long term lead to account bans.</li>
            <li><b>BUG-FIX:</b> Additional error handling if the data provided by the CSFloat API contains errors or wrong information. Fixes an issue that previous led to a crash when CSFloat supplied a sticker name with wrong capitalization.</li>
            <li><b>BUG-FIX:</b> A long-time bug of the stop button not actually stopping the refreshing due to a data race should now be fixed.</li>

            What's wrong?
        </p>
        <ul class="VersionText">
            <li>Both the niko and NiKo stickers currently lead to errors due to their only difference being capilization. This may lead to such stickers not linking to their Buff page or missing in sticker price calculations. Possible fixes are already getting investigated and will be included in a future version.</li>

            <li><b>FEATURE:</b> Back to top button: when scrolling down, a "back to top"-button will now appear in the bottom right corner. On click, you will smoothly get back to the top of the page.</li>
            <li><b>FEATURE:</b> Item popups now display the highest/lowest recorded past price above its history graph. This price always refers to the daily average, as this is the only data available on CSFloat. As I believe that this can never negatively impact the user's experience, this is an always-on feature for now.</li>
            <li><b>SETTING:</b> A new setting allows for variation of the content in the sale-tag next to a listings price. The options are to either keep the original price difference to the Steam price in percentage or see the price difference to the Buff price in absolute values. Default value is Buff.</li>

            <li>Since version 1.1.0 case-sensitive OS (e.g. Ubuntu, Android) did occasionally print errors due to the changed capitalization of file names.

            <li><b>FEATURE:</b> Sticker Prices → A new tag above the applied stickers now displays a calculated sticker price percentage. This SP% is depicted by the ratio of the item price difference to the total buff price (ask) of all stickers. This feature can be disabled in the popup (default: on).</li>
            <li><b>POPUP:</b> Completely reworked the logic behind the popup. It now also features a 'changelog' tab displaying the latest changes.</li>
            <li><b>BACKGROUND:</b> The extension is now able to detect and make use of the CSFloat API requests already sent by the website. This will allow many new possibilities in the future.</li>
            <li><b>TECH-STACK:</b> Building and deploying the extension is now done using webpack. This allows for a much cleaner codebase and easier development. Please refer to the new README for more information.</li>
